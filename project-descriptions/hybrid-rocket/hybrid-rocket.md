This is my hybrid rocket motor, designed as part of my capstone project. To date, I have completed initial hot fire testing with a successful 2 second duration burn. I will be completing several more tests as I complete my capstone project, investigating the regression rate of different solid fuel grain geometries. 

The motor uses solid PETG (3D printed) fuel and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) as the oxidiser. The rocket is designed to produce 500 N of thrust at a chamber pressure of 30 bar for a full duration burn of 4 seconds.

My design consists of a machined aluminium outer casing which the injector and nozzle housing bolts onto using 4x M5 bolts on each side. These sections seal against the casing using piston o-ring seals with PTFE backup rings. The nozzle housing has a graphite nozzle press fit into it. The solid fuel grain sits inside the casing, providing thermal insulation to the aluminium.

As the sole contributor, I have completed all aspects of the motor design. This has included:

- Designing motor architecture based on research of hybrid motors.
- Designing combustion chamber capable of withstanding high pressure and temperature environment.
- Designing o-ring sealing of injector and nozzle to combustion chamber casing.
- Modelling of various motor subsystems in ANSYS Mechanical and Fluid (FEA and CFD).
- Sizing of injectors to ensure correct oxidiser flow rate to meet required thrust.
- Creation of manufacturing drawings of parts for manufacture by an external provider. This involved specifying tolerances which allowed the o-rings to seal properly whilst also meeting the manufacturers minimum tolerances.
- Manufacturing of graphite nozzle insert on manual lathe.
- Conduct hydrostatic pressure testing of the combustion chamber.
- Conduct hot-fire testing of the motor.
